          <p class="legacy-text">The earliest known American lodges were in Pennsylvania. The Collector for the port of Pennsylvania, John Moore,
            wrote of attending lodges there in 1715, two years before the formation of the first Grand Lodge in London. The
            Premier Grand Lodge of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731, based in Pennsylvania.
            Other lodges in the colony obtained authorizations from the later Ancient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of
            Scotland, and the Grand Lodge of Ireland, which was particularly well represented in the travelling lodges of the
            British Army. Many lodges came into existence with no warrant from any Grand Lodge, applying and paying for their
            authorization only after they were confident of their own survival.
          </p>
          <p class="legacy-text">
            After the American Revolution, independent U.S. Grand Lodges developed within each state. Some thought was briefly
            given to organizing an overarching "Grand Lodge of the United States," with George Washington (who was a member of a
            Virginian lodge) as the first Grand Master, but the idea was short-lived. The various state Grand Lodges did not wish
            to diminish their own authority by agreeing to such a body.

          </header>
          <p class="text-muted legacy-text">
            Prince Hall Freemasonry exists because of the refusal of early American lodges to admit African Americans. In 1775, an
            African American named Prince Hall, along with 14 other African American men, was initiated into a British military
            lodge with a warrant from the Grand Lodge of Ireland, having failed to obtain admission from the other lodges in
            Boston. When the British military Lodge left North America after the end of the Revolution, those 15 men were given
            the authority to meet as a Lodge, but not to initiate Masons. In 1784, these individuals obtained a Warrant from the
            Premier Grand Lodge of England (GLE) and formed African Lodge No. 459. When the UGLE was formed in 1813, all
            U.S.-based Lodges were stricken from their rolls – due largely to the War of 1812. Thus, separated from both UGLE and
            any concordantly recognized U.S. Grand Lodge, African Lodge re-titled itself as the African Lodge No. 1 – and became a
            de facto "Grand Lodge" (this Lodge is not to be confused with the various Grand Lodges on the Continent of Africa). As
            with the rest of U.S. Freemasonry, Prince Hall Freemasonry soon grew and organised a Grand Lodge system for each
            state.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted legacy-text">
            Widespread racial segregation in the 19th- and early 20th-century North America made it difficult for African
            Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions and impossible for inter-jurisdiction recognition
            between the parallel U.S. Masonic authorities. By the 1980s, such discrimination was a thing of the past. Today most
            U.S. Grand Lodges recognize their Prince Hall counterparts, and the authorities of both organizations are working
            towards full Masonic recognition including mutual visitation, if not already implemented. The United Grand Lodge of
            England has no problem with recognizing Prince Hall Grand Lodges. While celebrating their heritage as Masonic lodges
            of African Americans, the Prince Hall jurisdictions are open to all men regardless of race or religion.
